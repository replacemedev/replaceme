  A focused development workflow engine for AI coding agents, invoked as
  `/absolute <command> [target]`. One skill, eleven commands. One sets it up:
  `init` (interview how you want absolute to behave + detect the stack once, then write
  JSON config — `.absolute.config.json` per project and `~/.absolute/config.json` for
  user defaults and per-project overrides — that every other command reads instead of
  re-detecting; non-blocking, the others soft-recommend it).
  Five cover the build loop
  you run every day — think → spec → plan → build → polish → document:
  `work` (end-to-end, phase-gated SDLC: relentless design interview → reviewed
  spec → dependency-graphed task board → safe-wave TDD execution → verification),
  `spec` (lightweight standalone design spec: codebase scan → bounded clarify pass
  → write a reviewed design doc to docs/plans → scored reviewer subagent → stop,
  no build),
  `ui` (polished, intentional interface design with concrete CSS/Tailwind values —
  typography, color, layout, dark mode, accessibility, animations),
  `simplify` (autonomously simplify your working git changes — reduce complexity,
  remove redundancy, keep tests green), and
  `docs` (Diátaxis-driven documentation — tutorials, how-tos, reference,
  explanation, READMEs, ADRs, with stack detection and code-verified accuracy).
  Five more keep the codebase healthy — standing maintenance on green main, each a
  risk-ranked, gated, safe-wave scan-and-fix:
  `upgrade` (dependency upgrades — outdated/vulnerable deps bumped in semver waves,
  majors gated and changelog-read, tests green after each),
  `audit` (vulnerability & security scan — dependency CVEs plus risky code patterns,
  severity-triaged and remediated; defensive, on your own repo),
  `prune` (dead code & dependency cleanup — unused deps, exports, files removed with
  evidence, repo-wide),
  `debt` (lint & typecheck debt paydown — clear pre-existing warnings/errors and
  suppressions by rule, no cheating the checker), and
  `deflake` (flaky test fixes — diagnose and fix the root nondeterminism, never
  retry/skip/sleep).

# Absolute — Development Workflow Engine

One skill, eleven commands, dispatched as `/absolute <command> [target]`. One sets it up,
the rest split into two families:

**Setup** (run once per repo): `init` — interview + stack detection → JSON config the other commands read.

**Build loop** (the everyday flow):
**think → plan → build** (`work`) → **spec only** (`spec`) → **design** (`ui`) → **polish** (`simplify`) → **document** (`docs`)

**Engineering health** (standing maintenance on green `main`):
`upgrade` (deps) · `audit` (security) · `prune` (dead code) · `debt` (lint/type) · `deflake` (flaky tests)

The body of each command lives in `references/<command>.md`. This file is the
router: it decides which command the user wants, loads that reference, and follows
it. The command references are long and opinionated — load only the one in play. The
five health commands share one loop in `references/health-engine.md` (loaded by each).

## Commands

| Command | Phase | What it does | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `init` | Setup | One-time setup: interview how you want absolute to behave (output style, autonomy/gating, TDD strictness, spec dir, families) + detect the stack once, then write `.absolute.config.json` (project, committed) and optionally `~/.absolute/config.json` (user defaults + per-project overrides). Every other command reads it instead of re-detecting; non-destructive, never commits. | [references/init.md](references/init.md) |
| `work [target]` | Think · Plan · Build | End-to-end, phase-gated SDLC: relentless design interview → reviewed spec → dependency-graphed task board → safe-wave TDD execution → verification → converge. Handles features, bugs, refactors, greenfield, planning breakdowns, migrations. | [references/work.md](references/work.md) |
| `spec [target]` | Plan | Lightweight standalone design spec — for when you want a doc to discuss or hand off, not build now. Codebase scan → bounded clarify pass (a few questions, not a grill) → write a reviewed spec to `docs/plans/` → independent scored review → stop. Reuses `work`'s spec template + rubric. | [references/spec.md](references/spec.md) |
| `ui [target]` | Design | Build polished, intentional UIs with concrete CSS/Tailwind values: typography, color, layout, spacing, dark mode, accessibility, animations, components. The most comprehensive UI knowledge base, not vague advice. | [references/ui.md](references/ui.md) |
| `simplify [target]` | Polish | Autonomously simplify your staged/unstaged git changes or a target path — reduce complexity, flatten nesting, remove redundancy and dead code — then run tests to prove nothing broke. | [references/simplify.md](references/simplify.md) |
| `docs [target]` | Document | Diátaxis-driven documentation: write, improve, or audit tutorials, how-tos, reference, explanation, and developer docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, ADRs). Detects the docs stack; verifies every claim against the code. | [references/docs.md](references/docs.md) |
| `upgrade [target]` | Health | Dependency upgrades: list outdated/vulnerable deps, plan them into semver waves (patch/minor batched, majors gated + changelog-read), apply incrementally, regenerate lockfiles, tests green after each. | [references/upgrade.md](references/upgrade.md) |
| `audit [target]` | Health | Vulnerability & security scan (defensive, your own repo): dependency CVEs + risky code patterns (secrets, injection, weak authz), severity × reachability triaged, remediated without suppressing. Complements built-in `/security-review`. | [references/audit.md](references/audit.md) |
| `prune [target]` | Health | Dead code & dependency cleanup, repo-wide: unused deps, unreferenced exports, unreachable code, orphaned files — removed only with tool evidence, in reversible waves. (Diff-scoped cleanup is `simplify`.) | [references/prune.md](references/prune.md) |
| `debt [target]` | Health | Lint & typecheck debt paydown: clear pre-existing repo-wide lint/type violations and suppressions (`@ts-ignore`, `# type: ignore`) one rule per wave, fixing causes not symptoms. (Diff-scoped quality is `simplify`.) | [references/debt.md](references/debt.md) |
| `deflake [target]` | Health | Flaky test fixes: detect nondeterministic tests empirically (repeat/shuffle/parallel runs), diagnose the root cause, fix it — never retry/skip/sleep — and verify across many randomized runs. | [references/deflake.md](references/deflake.md) |

## Routing rules

Resolve the command on every invocation, then hand off to its reference.

1. **First word matches a command** (`init`, `work`, `spec`, `ui`, `simplify`, `docs`,
   `upgrade`, `audit`, `prune`, `debt`, `deflake`) → read `references/<command>.md`
   and follow it exactly. Everything after the command name is the target/argument.

2. **First word doesn't match, but the intent clearly maps to one command** → load
   that command's reference and proceed as if it was invoked explicitly:
   - "set up / initialize / configure absolute", "first-time setup", "remember my
     conventions/preferences for this repo" → **init**
   - "build X end-to-end", "plan and build", "break this into tasks", "grill me on
     this plan", "pick up this ticket", "run this migration" → **work**
   - "write a spec", "spec out this feature", "draft a design doc for X", "I want a
     spec to hand off / review, don't build it yet" → **spec**
     (The fork vs `work`: `spec` writes a reviewed design doc and stops; `work` writes
     the doc *and* builds it. When unsure if they'll build now, prefer `spec` — it can
     chain into `work` afterward.)
   - "design a pricing page", "style this component", "make this less like AI
     slop", "fix the spacing/typography/color", "dark mode" → **ui**
   - "simplify this", "clean up my changes", "refactor this", "reduce complexity",
     "remove dead code", "tidy this up" → **simplify**
   - "write docs/a tutorial/a README", "document this", "improve this doc",
     "audit our docs", "restructure the documentation" → **docs**
   - "upgrade our dependencies", "bump deps", "update packages", "move off the
     deprecated X", "clear the Dependabot backlog" → **upgrade**
   - "security audit", "are we vulnerable", "scan for CVEs", "check for secrets/
     injection", "harden this" → **audit** (defensive, whole repo; pair with the
     built-in `/security-review` for the pending diff)
   - "remove dead code", "find unused deps/exports", "what can we delete", "clean up
     orphaned files" (repo-wide) → **prune**
   - "fix our lint warnings", "clear the type errors", "get to strict mode", "burn
     down `@ts-ignore`/suppressions" → **debt**
   - "fix flaky tests", "CI is flaky", "this test fails randomly/intermittently" → **deflake**

   Disambiguation: **`prune`/`debt`** act repo-wide on green `main`; **`simplify`**
   acts on *your working diff* — route by scope. **`audit`** (the command) scans the
   whole repo for security; "audit our docs" still → **docs**.

   If two commands genuinely fit, ask once which the user wants. Otherwise pick the
   clear match and state which command you loaded.

3. **No argument** (`/absolute` alone) → do not auto-run anything. Present the
   command table above, then recommend the 1–2 highest-value next commands based
   on context (e.g. uncommitted changes → `simplify`; a fresh ticket or vague
   goal → `work`, or `spec` if the user only wants a design doc to hand off; UI
   files in the diff → `ui`; missing or stale docs → `docs`; outdated/vulnerable
   deps in the manifest → `upgrade`/`audit`; failing or flaky CI → `deflake`;
   no config present yet → suggest `init` first). The recommendation is a suggestion
   the user confirms.

4. **No clear command match at all** → treat the full input as a development task
   and load **work** (the default lifecycle), using the input as the brief.

### Config resolution (before handing off to any command except `init`)

Resolve effective config by overlaying, highest wins: `./.absolute.config.json` (project) →
`~/.absolute/config.json` `projects["<cwd>"]` → `~/.absolute/config.json` `defaults`.
Shallow-merge `conventions` and `preferences`. Apply the resolved preferences to the
command (output style, autonomy/gating, TDD strictness, spec dir).

If **no** project or global config exists, emit one line then continue with on-the-fly
detection — do **not** block:

> No absolute config found — `/absolute init` caches your stack + preferences so commands
> skip re-detection. Continuing with on-the-fly detection.

This is a soft recommendation, shown at most once per invocation. See
[references/init.md](references/init.md) for the schema and precedence.

Once a command reference is loaded, follow its own activation banner, gates, and
flow. Sub-command references do not re-invoke this router.

## Principles shared across commands

- **Codebase before questions.** Read what exists before asking; ask only what the
  code cannot answer.
- **Gate before expensive work.** `work` gates between phases; `docs` gates on the
  outline; `simplify` is bounded to scoped changes; `spec` stops at the reviewed doc
  and never starts building; the health commands (`upgrade`/`audit`/`prune`/`debt`/
  `deflake`) present risk-ranked findings and gate before applying any fix. Never
  silently expand scope.
- **Verify, don't assume.** Prove behavior with tests, real output, and code-checked
  facts — never aspirational claims.
- **Never auto-commit.** Every command writes files and reports; the user commits.
