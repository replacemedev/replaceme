# Supabase

## Core Principles

### 1. Supabase changes frequently — verify before implementing

Do not rely on training data for Supabase features. Function signatures, `config.toml` settings, and API conventions change between versions.

First, fetch `https://supabase.com/changelog.md` (a lightweight summary index — not a heavy pull), scan for breaking-change tags relevant to your task, and follow the linked page for any that apply. Then look up the relevant topic using the documentation access methods below.

### 2. Verify your work

After implementing any fix, run a test query to confirm the change works. A fix without verification is incomplete.

### 3. Recover from errors, don't loop

If an approach fails after 2–3 attempts, stop and reconsider. Try a different method, check documentation, inspect the error more carefully, and review relevant logs when available. Supabase issues are not always solved by retrying the same command, and the answer is not always in the logs, but logs are often worth checking before proceeding.

### 4. Exposing tables to the Data API

Depending on the user's Data API settings, newly created tables may not be automatically exposed via the Data (REST) API. If this is the case, `anon` and `authenticated` roles need to be explicitly granted access via `GRANT` SQL.

This is separate from RLS — RLS controls which rows are visible once a table is accessible, not whether the table is accessible at all.

When a user reports a SQL-created table is unexpectedly inaccessible, check their Data API settings and whether the roles have been granted access. When granting public (`anon`/`authenticated`) access, always enable RLS too.

```sql
-- Full setup: expose table and protect it
grant usage on schema public to anon, authenticated;
grant select on public.posts to anon;
grant select, insert, update, delete on public.posts to authenticated;
alter table public.posts enable row level security;
```

### 5. RLS in exposed schemas

Enable RLS on every table in any exposed schema (which includes `public` by default). Tables in exposed schemas can be reachable through the Data API when roles have access. For private schemas, prefer RLS as defense in depth.

After enabling RLS, create policies that match the actual access model rather than defaulting every table to the same `auth.uid()` pattern.

### 6. Security Checklist

When working on any task touching auth, RLS, views, storage, or user data, check each item below. These are Supabase-specific security traps that silently create vulnerabilities.

## Security Checklist

### Auth and Session Security

**Never use `user_metadata` claims in authorization.** In Supabase, `raw_user_meta_data` is user-editable and can appear in `auth.jwt()`, so it is unsafe for RLS policies or any other authorization logic. Store authorization data in `raw_app_meta_data` / `app_metadata` instead.

**Deleting a user does not invalidate existing access tokens.** Sign out or revoke sessions first. Keep JWT expiry short for sensitive apps. For strict guarantees, validate `session_id` against `auth.sessions` on sensitive operations.

**JWT claims are not always fresh.** If you use `app_metadata` or `auth.jwt()` for authorization, claims may be stale until the user's token is refreshed.

### API Key and Client Exposure

**Never expose the `service_role` or secret key in public clients.** Use publishable keys for frontend code. In Next.js, any `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env var is sent to the browser — never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` or similar.

### RLS, Views, and Privileged Database Code

**Views bypass RLS by default.** In Postgres 15 and above, use `CREATE VIEW ... WITH (security_invoker = true)`. In older versions, protect views by revoking access from `anon` and `authenticated` roles, or by placing them in an unexposed schema.

**UPDATE requires a SELECT policy.** Without a SELECT policy, updates silently return 0 rows — no error, just no change.

**`auth.role()` is deprecated — use the `TO` clause instead.** `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` silently breaks when anonymous sign-ins are enabled, because anonymous users carry the `authenticated` Postgres role.

```sql
-- Deprecated — do not use
create policy "example" on table_name for select
using ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

-- Correct
create policy "example" on table_name for select
to authenticated
using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
```

**`TO authenticated` alone is authentication without authorization (BOLA/IDOR).** Using `TO authenticated` only checks the role — it does not restrict which rows the user can access. Always combine with an ownership predicate in `USING`:

```sql
-- Wrong — anyone authenticated can read ALL rows
create policy "bad" on table_name for select
to authenticated
using ( true );

-- Correct — user can only read their own rows
create policy "good" on table_name for select
to authenticated
using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
```

**UPDATE policies require both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`.** Without `WITH CHECK`, a user can reassign a row's `user_id` to another user:

```sql
-- Wrong — allows user_id reassignment
create policy "bad update" on table_name for update
to authenticated
using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );

-- Correct
create policy "safe update" on table_name for update
to authenticated
using  ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id )
with check ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
```

**`SECURITY DEFINER` functions bypass RLS.** A `SECURITY DEFINER` function runs with its creator's privileges — typically a role with `bypassrls` (e.g., `postgres`). Never add `SECURITY DEFINER` to resolve a permission error; it silently removes access control without fixing the underlying cause. Prefer `SECURITY INVOKER`.

**`SECURITY DEFINER` functions in `public` are callable by all roles.** Postgres grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` by default for every new function. Any `SECURITY DEFINER` function in `public` is therefore callable by `anon` and `authenticated` without any additional grant.

When `SECURITY DEFINER` is genuinely needed (e.g., bypassing RLS on an internal lookup table):
- Keep the function in a non-exposed schema
- Always include an `auth.uid()` check in the function body
- Run `supabase db advisors` after making changes

### Storage Access Control

**Storage upsert requires `INSERT + SELECT + UPDATE`.** Granting only `INSERT` allows new uploads but file replacement (upsert) silently fails.

## Supabase CLI

Always discover commands via `--help` — never guess. The CLI structure changes between versions.

```sh
supabase --help                    # all top-level commands
supabase <group> --help            # subcommands (e.g., supabase db --help)
supabase <group> <command> --help  # flags for a specific command
```

**Known gotchas:**
- `supabase db query` requires CLI v2.79.0+ → use MCP `execute_sql` or `psql` as fallback
- `supabase db advisors` requires CLI v2.81.3+ → use MCP `get_advisors` as fallback

When you need a new migration SQL file, always create it with `supabase migration new <name>` first. Never invent a migration filename or rely on memory for the expected format.

**Version check and upgrade:** Run `supabase --version` to check. For CLI changelogs and version-specific features, consult the CLI documentation or GitHub releases.

## Supabase MCP Server

**Troubleshooting connection issues** — follow in order:

1. **Check if the server is reachable:**
   ```sh
   curl -so /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp
   ```
   A `401` is expected (no token) and means the server is up. Timeout or "connection refused" means it may be down.

2. **Check `.mcp.json` configuration:** Verify the project root has a valid `.mcp.json` with the correct server URL (`https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp`). If missing, create one.

3. **Authenticate the MCP server:** If the server is reachable and `.mcp.json` is correct but tools aren't visible, the user needs to authenticate. The Supabase MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 — tell the user to trigger the auth flow in their agent, complete it in the browser, and reload the session.

## Supabase Documentation

Before implementing any Supabase feature, find the relevant documentation. Use in priority order:

1. **MCP `search_docs` tool** (preferred — returns relevant snippets directly)
2. **Fetch docs pages as markdown** — append `.md` to any docs page URL path
3. **Web search** for Supabase-specific topics when you don't know which page to check

## Making and Committing Schema Changes

To make schema changes, use `execute_sql` (MCP) or `supabase db query` (CLI). These run SQL directly on the database without creating migration history entries, so you can iterate freely and generate a clean migration when ready.

**Do NOT use `apply_migration` to change a local database schema** — it writes a migration history entry on every call, so you can't iterate, and `supabase db diff` / `supabase db pull` will produce empty or conflicting diffs.

### Migration Commit Workflow

When ready to commit changes to a migration file:

```sh
# Step 1 — Run advisors
supabase db advisors              # CLI v2.81.3+
# or use MCP get_advisors
# Fix any issues before continuing.

# Step 2 — Review the Security Checklist
# Required if changes involve views, functions, triggers, or storage.

# Step 3 — Generate the migration
supabase db pull <descriptive-name> --local --yes

# Step 4 — Verify
supabase migration list --local
```
